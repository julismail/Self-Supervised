Malware Classification method with Self-supervised learning

this is the repository of our paper "Malware detection system with self-supervised learning and Image Representation"
We developed a malware detection system with contrastive learning and Convolutional Neural Network Resnet18 architecture.  
We trained the model with unlabeled CIFAR10 dataset as a pretext task. 
Then, we retrained the model to recognize malware image representation in Downstream Task.  
We tested the system on two Downstream tasks: 
(1) malware family classification with Malimg dataset, and 
(2) malware benign classification with Debi dataset.
